all: testlist


#
# The first target is the default: what to build if you just say "make"
#
#
#  Rebuild testlist whenever either testlist.o or namelist.o have changed.
#  The 2nd line gives the command used to create testlist from those .o 
#  files.
testlist: testlist.o namelist.o
	g++ $(CPPFLAGS) -o testlist testlist.o namelist.o $(LFLAGS)

#
# Other files to build
#

#
# Build testlist.o from testlist.cpp 
# Because we don't give a rule here for how to do this, the default rule
# for producing .o files from .cpp files, defined above, will be used.
#
# The dependencies here indicate that testlist.o needs to be rebuilt 
# whenever we have made a change to either testlist.cpp or namelist.h
#
testlist.o: testlist.cpp namelist.h
	g++ $(CPPFLAGS) -c testlist.cpp namelist.h
#
# Build namelist.o from namelist.cpp 
# Again, we use the default rule for producing .o files from .cpp files.
#
# The dependencies here indicate that namelist.o needs to be rebuilt 
# whenever we have made a change to either namelist.cpp or namelist.h
#
namelist.o: namelist.cpp namelist.h
	g++ $(CPPFLAGS) -c namelist.cpp namelist.h


#
# A dummy target: "make clean" will remove all files that "make" produces.

clean:
